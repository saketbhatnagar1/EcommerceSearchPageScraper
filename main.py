webdriver.Chrome()
Initializes an instance of the Chrome WebDriver, allowing automated interactions with a Chrome browser.

driver.get(url)
Opens the specified URL (http://www.python.org in this case) in the browser controlled by WebDriver.

driver.title
Retrieves the title of the current webpage.

assert
A Python keyword used for validation. It ensures that the specified condition is True. If not, the script raises an AssertionError.

driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")
Locates a single web element using its "name" attribute. In this case, it finds the search bar on Python.org.

elem.clear()
Clears the text from an input field if thereâ€™s any pre-existing text.

elem.send_keys("pycon")
Simulates typing the string "pycon" into the identified element (elem).

Keys.RETURN
Simulates pressing the ENTER key. Used here to submit the search form.
driver.page_source

Retrieves the entire HTML source of the current webpage. Used to verify that "No results found." is not present.
driver.close()

Closes the browser window and ends the session associated with the WebDriver.
How the Script Works
Opens a Chrome browser and navigates to Python.org.
Checks the page title to confirm successful navigation.
Finds the search bar, clears it, types in "pycon," and submits the search.
Verifies that the search returns results by checking the absence of "No results found."
Closes the browser after completing the test.
This script automates a simple search functionality test on the Python.org website.
